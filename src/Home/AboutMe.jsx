                        I'm pursuing an M.S. in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute in New York, driven by my passion for design and innovation.
                        <br /><br />
                        In my previous role as a UX designer at Anise Health, I didn't just create products - I brought two groundbreaking solutions to life, championing HCD principles and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
                        <br /><br />
                        My UX adventure began with a Master degree in Architecture from the National University of Singapore, followed by a transformative UX design internship at Philips, where I focused on healthcare solutions for Alzheimer's patients and their families.
                        <br /><br />
                        With a global perspective shaped by living in five cities across three countries , I thrive in diverse cultural contexts, using this diversity to fuel my creative thinking.
                        <br /><br />
                        My background in architecture equips me to approach challenges with an open mindset, skillfully navigate complex scenarios, address problems from multiple angles, and consider both macro and micro perspectives.
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm thrilled to join open and diverse teams, eager to dive into exhilarating explorations to create user-centric, impactful solutions. Let's ignite innovation together!Out of work, you will find me practicing yoga üßò, cooking ü•ò, visiting museum üñºÔ∏è.
