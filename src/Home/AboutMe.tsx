                                Hi, I'm Kiyo.<br />
                                Nice to meet you:)
                            </Typography>

                                I'm pursuing an M.S. in Information Experience Design at Pratt Institute in New York, driven by my passion for design and innovation.
                                <br /><br />
                                In my previous role as a UX designer at <HighLight>Anise Health</HighLight>, I didn't just create products - I brought two groundbreaking solutions to life, championing HCD principles and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
                                <br /><br />
                                My UX adventure began with a Master degree in Architecture from the <HighLight>National University of Singapore</HighLight>, followed by a transformative UX design internship at <HighLight>Philips</HighLight>, where I focused on healthcare solutions for Alzheimer's patients and their families.
                                <br /><br />
                                With a global perspective shaped by living in five cities across three countries, I thrive in diverse cultural contexts, using this diversity to fuel my creative thinking.
                                <br /><br />
                                My background in architecture equips me to approach challenges with an open mindset, skillfully navigate complex scenarios, address problems from multiple angles, and consider both macro and micro perspectives.
                                <br /><br />
                                I'm thrilled to join open and diverse teams, eager to dive into exhilarating explorations to create user-centric, impactful solutions. Let's ignite innovation together!
                                <br /><br />
